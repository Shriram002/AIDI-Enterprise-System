Model 1 : Logistic Regression:

It is most useful when the outcome is binary in nature: either/or or yes/no decisions.

Simple and interpretable model.

Provides probability estimates.

Model 2 : Random Forest:

It is useful for numeric and categorical targets due to its flexibility in terms of problem encoding.

Effectiveness against overfitting since it is an ensemble based approach.

The efficiency of the algorithms in the case of data handling and imposing large numbers of predictors in the model.

Therfore, Both models are useful, and are chosen based on the problem being solved, the structure of the data and whether the key focus is on the interpretability of the results or more on prediction.
